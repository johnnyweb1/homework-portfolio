	<h2>Creating a people centric software business</h2>

	<p> I'm John Webster, an IT Infrastructure Manager from Melbourne. I have 20 years experience building and managing complex networks. I'm branching out to create my own software company <a href="http://www.paritybit.io" target="blank">Parity Bit</a>, and I'm learning front end development tools to help me understand what's needed in the development process. 
	<hr>
	I'm designing an application that lets employers and staff build shifts collaboratively by advertising and then nominating for shifts that suit. People can also swap shifts with each other, without having to get formal approval all from their phone or computer.
